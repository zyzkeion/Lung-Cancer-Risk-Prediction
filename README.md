The Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China, which includes nine cities in Guangdong Province as well as Hong Kong and Macao, is densely populated, with a total of 84.4 million residents. 
 This region is characterized by a distinctive Guangfu culture and well-developed shipping and trade networks. We conducted a census survey involving 158,460 permanent residents from 245 counties (districts) in the PRD region, all of whom have household registration in 29 provinces and municipalities directly under the central government (including Macao, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) and are covered by the government's Medicare Supplement Insurance. 
 Free low-dose CT screenings were provided for individuals at high risk of lung cancer. 
 The data encompassed the entire age range (1-98 years), and the outcome variable (lung nodule or lung cancer) was determined based on confirmed diagnoses or complete CT examination reports for lung nodules. 
 Our study identified the unique dietary habits of the region as a significant factor contributing to the elevated risk of lung cancer. Our screening model is designed for primary prevention, focusing on early detection, diagnosis, and treatment.
 It can be utilized to rapidly identify individuals at high risk for lung cancer across all age groups in the PRD region.
 Additionally, it has clinical applications, allowing for the quick assessment of lung cancer risk during consultations based on the patient's medical history, lifestyle, family history, and a combination of clinical signs and symptoms, rather than relying solely on age and smoking history. 
 Increasing the number of learning samples could enhance the accuracy of the model in future applications.
 中国的珠三角地区包括广东省9个城市及香港和澳门，人口稠密（8440万人），该地区具有独特的广府文化以及发达的航运和贸易往来。我们采用普查的方式对户籍地为中国29个省份和直辖市（包括澳门、香港和台湾）、245个县（区）的珠三角地区参与政府医疗保险附加保险的158460位常住居民进行了调查，对于存在肺癌高风险的人群开展了免费的低剂量CT检查。数据覆盖全年龄段人群（1-98岁），结局变量（肺结节或肺癌）是依据确诊情况或具有完整CT检查报告（对于肺结节）。我们的研究发现该地区独特的饮食习惯是造成肺癌高风险的重要因素之一。我们的筛查模型是为一级预防（早发现、早诊断、早治疗）所设计，可以为珠三角地区全年龄段人群进行肺癌高风险的快速筛查，同时也兼顾了临床应用，在就诊时可以快速根据病人的既往史、生活习惯、家族遗传史以及结合临床查体体征做出肺癌高风险的判断（并非仅依赖于年龄和吸烟史），并可在后续使用中增加学习样本以达到更精确的程度。
