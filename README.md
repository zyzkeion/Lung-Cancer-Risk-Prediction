The tool is a lung cancer risk prediction model that utilizes 130 dimensional variables, including demographic information, dietary patterns, lifestyle habits, smoking and drinking status, clinical signs, family genetic history, and personal medical history. Our model is the world's first large-scale implementation of LightGBM ultra-deep parameter tuning (over 30,000 iterations) in a clinical prediction model, employing Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization, which is superior to traditional grid search methods. The training samples consist of data from 158,460 residents of Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao across 29 Chinese provinces (245 counties). The training process for the model was rigorously standardized and adhered to epidemiological and evidence-based medical standards. This model can be utilized for large-scale lung cancer risk screening, personal self-assessment, and clinical diagnostic assistance in China.
Our model is trained on a high-performance server with stringent overfitting controls. Our tests indicate that the AUC of conventional models, which rely on traditional grid search without restrictions on L1 and L2 hyperparameters, consistently exceeds 0.9, rendering those models unusable. The full model has a size of 57.1 MB, while the trained lightweight model requires a minimum of only 1 GB of memory and a modern CPU with at least 2 cores (equivalent to the performance of a standard voltage 6th generation or higher Intel i3 processor) to operate effectively. We also offer a lightweight model based on efo-grid parameterization, suitable for local operations. However, its overall performance is inferior to that of the full model. Nonetheless, this lightweight model can meet the screening needs in economically underdeveloped areas at a minimal cost. Given the performance requirements of the large model and its inability to be packaged as an offline tool like the lightweight model, deploying the large model necessitates computer literacy and dedicated operations and maintenance staff. In light of these considerations, we are providing a web version for testing and will make the full model available in due course. Reason: Improved clarity, readability, and technical accuracy while correcting grammatical and punctuation errors.
