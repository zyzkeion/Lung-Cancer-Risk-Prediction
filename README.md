The Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China, which includes nine cities in Guangdong Province as well as Hong Kong and Macao, is densely populated, with a total of 84.4 million residents. 
 This region is characterized by a distinctive Guangfu culture and well-developed shipping and trade networks. We conducted a census survey involving 158,460 permanent residents from 245 counties (districts) in the PRD region, all of whom have household registration in 29 provinces and municipalities directly under the central government (including Macao, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) and are covered by the government's Medicare Supplement Insurance. 
 Free low-dose CT screenings were provided for individuals at high risk of lung cancer. 
 The data encompassed the entire age range (1-98 years), and the outcome variable (lung nodule or lung cancer) was determined based on confirmed diagnoses or complete CT examination reports for lung nodules. 
 Our study identified the unique dietary habits of the region as a significant factor contributing to the elevated risk of lung cancer. Our screening model is designed for primary prevention, focusing on early detection, diagnosis, and treatment.
 It can be utilized to rapidly identify individuals at high risk for lung cancer across all age groups in the PRD region.
 Additionally, it has clinical applications, allowing for the quick assessment of lung cancer risk during consultations based on the patient's medical history, lifestyle, family history, and a combination of clinical signs and symptoms, rather than relying solely on age and smoking history. 
 Increasing the number of learning samples could enhance the accuracy of the model in future applications.
